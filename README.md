<h1 >YouTube Music</h1>

<p>Welcome to the "YouTube Music" repository. This is a coded version of a previously designed interface design.</p>

<h3>Only with HTML and Tailwind CSS technology.</h3>
<p>I used only HTML and Tailwind CSS technologies in this project. I made a copy of YouTube Music because I thought it would improve my coding skills for a copy of existing websites..</p>

<h3>View and browse the design freely with the demo.</h3>
<p>I will share the demo link to see the design and browse comfortably. <a href="https://youtubemusic-clone.netlify.app/" target="_blank">You can click me to see the demo.</a></p>
